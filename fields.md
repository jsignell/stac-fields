# fields.json

Remarks regarding the content of the `fields.json` file.

* CBERS (prefix `cbers:`) fields have been reviewed by Frederico Liporace.
* Planet (prefix `pl:`) is a guess until @cholmes provides a definitive list of fields for Planet.
* CARD4L for SAR (prefix `card4l:`) only lists the fields that need metadata more than just a label. This is to keep the fields.json small for now and not bloat it with a lot of fields from an extension that is pretty unstable.
* Sentinel (prefix `sentinel:`) is unofficial and a compilation from things found on the web. We may remove/change the fields in the future.
